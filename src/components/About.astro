    I’m Carey, a board-certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner with over a decade
    of experience caring for children and teens in emergency medicine. I created
    this practice to offer a more personal, accessible, and empowering approach to
    healthcare—right from home.

  <p class="text-left text-base text-gray-700">
    Whether you're a parent with questions or a teen looking for a safe space to
    talk, my goal is to provide trusted medical care with empathy, clarity, and
    zero judgment.

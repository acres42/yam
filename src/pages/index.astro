      I’m Carey, a board-certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner with over a decade of experience caring for children and teens in emergency medicine. After years in fast-paced hospital settings, I created this practice to offer families a more personal, accessible, and empowering approach to healthcare—right from the comfort of home.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base text-gray-700 text-left">
      I specialize in virtual care for children, young adults and college age folks, with a focus on sick visits, preventative wellness, and guidance through life’s big transitions. Whether you're a parent with questions or a teen looking for a safe space to talk, my goal is to provide trusted medical care with empathy, clarity, and zero judgment.
      This practice is built on relationships, education, and community—because real health starts with feeling seen and heard.
